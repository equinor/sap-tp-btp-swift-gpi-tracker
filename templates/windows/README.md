These template creates VMs based on the parameter files under the dev/ and test/ folder. 

This template (and KeyVault) would typically be loaded by the ```scripts/deploy.sh``` script.

Note that this way of deploying the VMs are quite a bit different than under the centos/ folder. 

The approach here is more suitable for "pet" type VMs, that has different parameters and characteristics.
The approach in the centos folder is more of a "cattle" approach where many identical VMs can be generated by looping over e.g. the vm names. 

Note that domain joining is determined by the "joinDomain" parameters set to either true or false.
